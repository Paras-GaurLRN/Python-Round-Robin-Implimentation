# Python-Round-Robin-Implimentation
A simple, time efficient and pythonic implementation of the Process Scheduling Algorithm - Round Robin

The Program has implimentation of a Process as a class with some general methods and warnings.

The program offers 2 Round Robin functions.

One for getting a gantt chart style execution order for a copy of the given set of processes.

Another for In-Place modifications thus 'consuming' the set of processes given to it.

The program also has a 'wrapper' to use the convey effect for even more effeciency for the set of processes.
